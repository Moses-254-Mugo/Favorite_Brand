                        While their rise to fame was somewhere between fast and meteoric, the Atlanta trio Migos steeped in the Southern 
                        tradition of hip-hop groups, having come together over their shared love of acts like the Hot Boys and OutKast. Members
                         Offset, Quavo, and Takeoff, who are all related, grew up together and first started making music in 2009 under the name 
                        Polo Club, with the name Migos becoming official in 2010. In 2012, they released the mixtape No Label, which featured the
                         cut <q>Bando,</q> a regional hit that caught the attention of producer Zaytoven and Kevin Lee, aka Coach K, the manager who 
                         launched the careers of Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy. The year 2013 was a whirlwind, as June saw the group drop their 
                         Young Rich N*ggas mixtape, which featured the instant hit <q>Versace.</q> That same year, Coach K got them on the Hot 107.9 
                         Birthday Bash, a popular Atlanta festival where Migos came across their newest fan, Drake. The rapper added a verse to 
                         the <q>Versace</q> remix and put the cut on his 2013 album Nothing Was the Same.
